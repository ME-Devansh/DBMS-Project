## Understanding the Project Struture

The project is divided into 2 parts :

- backend
The frontend is built on Java with the help of Swing. It contains the interfaces for 
various types of users that may access the only the information specific for their assigned roles.   

The backend is built on mySQL. The database has some dummy data which
